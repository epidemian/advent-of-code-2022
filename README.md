# Advent of Code 2022

## Goals

- Have fun
- Learn stuff
- Fast execution time (< 1 second for whole set of puzzles)
- Read inputs from files (or stdin) instead of `include_str!()`ing their contents into the executable
- (optional) Better error handling

## Learnings

### Day 1: Calorie Counting

Simple starter challenge. I learned how to read an entire file into a string :)
